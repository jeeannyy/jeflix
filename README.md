This is a clone of the Netflix website built using React.JS as a Front-end. It's not a replica and doesn't have all the features of the Netflix website. It's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, practising my React and TypeScript. The TV shows page, box component and search bar feature will be updated soon.
